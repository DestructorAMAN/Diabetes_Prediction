# Diabetes - Prediction

Diabetes is a condition where the body fails to utilize the ingested glucose properly. This could be due to lack of the hormone insulin or because the insulin that is available is not working effectively. 
Symptoms of high blood sugar include frequent urination, increased thirst, and increased hunger. If left untreated, diabetes can cause many complications. Acute complications can include diabetic ketoacidosis, hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state, or death. Serious long-term complications include cardiovascular disease, stroke, chronic kidney disease, foot ulcers, and damage to the eyes.
Current practice in hospital is to collect required information for diabetes diagnosis through various tests and appropriate treatment is provided based on diagnosis. 

Ten baseline variables, age, sex, body mass index, average blood pressure, and six blood serum measurements were obtained for each diabetes patients, a quantitative measure of disease progression one year after baseline.

Attribute Information:
      
      Age    :  age in years,
      Gender :  male or female,     
      BMI    :  body mass index,
      BP     :  average blood pressure,
      
      s1     :  tc, T-Cells (a type of white blood cells)
      s2     :  ldl, low-density lipoproteins
      s3     :  hdl, high-density lipoproteins
      s4     :  tch, thyroid stimulating hormone
      s5     :  ltg, lamotrigine
      s6     :  glu, blood sugar level
     
Note: Each of these 10 feature variables have been mean centered and scaled by the standard deviation times 'n_samples' (i.e. the sum of squares of each column totals 1)
